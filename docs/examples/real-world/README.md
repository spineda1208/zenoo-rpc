export ODOO_URL="http://localhost:8069"
export ODOO_DB_NAME="your_database"
export ODOO_USERNAME="your_username"
export ODOO_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

### Running Examples

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Run enterprise e-commerce integration
python enterprise-ecommerce.py

# Run financial analytics dashboard
python financial-analytics.py

# Run customer service automation
python customer-service-automation.py

# Run supply chain optimization
python supply-chain-optimization.py

# Run performance benchmarks
python performance-benchmarks.py
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Common Design Patterns

All examples follow these production-ready patterns:

1. **Context Managers**: Proper resource management with async context managers
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies
3. **Logging**: Structured logging for production monitoring
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
5. **Performance**: Caching, rate limiting, and optimization
6. **Security**: Secure API key management and validation

### AI Integration Patterns

1. **Structured Output**: Using JSON schemas for consistent AI responses
2. **Context Awareness**: Maintaining conversation and business context
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation when AI services fail
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and request optimization
5. **Cost Management**: Token usage tracking and optimization

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Typical Performance Metrics

Based on real-world testing with Gemini API:

| Operation | Avg Response Time | Throughput (RPS) | Cost per 1K tokens |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Simple Chat | 0.5-1.0s | 10-20 | $0.002 |
| Query Explanation | 1.0-2.0s | 5-10 | $0.002 |
| Error Diagnosis | 1.5-3.0s | 3-8 | $0.002 |
| Model Generation | 3.0-8.0s | 1-3 | $0.002 |

### Optimization Recommendations

1. **Caching**: Implement response caching for repeated queries
2. **Batching**: Batch similar requests when possible
3. **Model Selection**: Use appropriate models for task complexity
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting
5. **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and costs

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Development Configuration

```python
# Development settings
AI_PROVIDER = "gemini"
AI_MODEL = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
AI_TEMPERATURE = 0.1
AI_MAX_TOKENS = 2048
AI_TIMEOUT = 15.0
AI_MAX_RETRIES = 2
```

### Production Configuration

```python
# Production settings
AI_PROVIDER = "gemini"
AI_MODEL = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
AI_TEMPERATURE = 0.05  # More deterministic
AI_MAX_TOKENS = 4096
AI_TIMEOUT = 60.0      # Longer timeout
AI_MAX_RETRIES = 5     # More retries
ENABLE_CACHING = True
ENABLE_MONITORING = True
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check API key is set
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
   
   # Test API connectivity
   python -c "import os; from zenoo_rpc import ZenooClient; print('API key:', bool(os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')))"
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   # Implement exponential backoff
   import asyncio
   import random
   
   async def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=5):
       for attempt in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return await func()
           except Exception as e:
               if "rate limit" in str(e).lower():
                   wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
                   await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
               else:
                   raise
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   ```python
   # Monitor memory usage
   import psutil
   
   def check_memory():
       memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
       if memory.percent > 80:
           print(f"High memory usage: {memory.percent}%")
   ```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Response Caching**
   ```python
   import hashlib
   import json
   
   def cache_key(prompt, model, temperature):
       key_data = {"prompt": prompt, "model": model, "temperature": temperature}
       return hashlib.md5(json.dumps(key_data, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()
   ```

2. **Connection Pooling**
   ```python
   # Reuse client connections
   async with client_pool.get_client() as client:
       result = await client.ai.chat(prompt)
   ```
